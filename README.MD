### Your entrance to kubernetes

Hello everybody, I am pleased to demonstrate some aspects of Kubernetes (k8s). First of all, I want to talk about the difference between k3s and k8s. k3s works almost with the same functionalities as k8s. However, k3s is lightweight, consumes fewer resources, and you can run it on low configuration systems.
